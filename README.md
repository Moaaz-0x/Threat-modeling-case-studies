# Threat Modeling Case Studies

This repository contains real world application security threat modeling case studies.

The focus of these case studies is secure by design thinking, authorization models, trust boundaries, and business driven security tradeoffs. Each case study follows a structured threat modeling approach based on software understanding, STRIDE classification, and mitigation decision making.

## What this repository demonstrates
- Practical threat modeling applied to real product features
- Identification of trust boundaries and security critical decisions
- Mapping threats to mitigations and design tradeoffs
- A focus on proactive secure design and threat modeling rather than reactive vulnerability discovery

## Structure
Each case study includes:
- A clear system overview and business context
- Architecture and data flow description
- Trust boundaries identification
- Threats categorized using STRIDE
- Security decisions and mitigations
- Tradeoffs, accepted or deferred risks
- Lessons learned

## Case studies
- [Secure External Project Sharing](https://github.com/Moaaz-0x/Threat-modeling-case-studies/tree/main/external-project-sharing)
- [Multi Tenant Task Authorization](https://github.com/Moaaz-0x/Threat-modeling-case-studies/tree/main/multi-tenant-task-authorization)

More case studies will be added over time.
